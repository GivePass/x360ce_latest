= Troubleshooting =

*Wheel doesn't work in the game, but it works inside x360ce Application.*

Some games will only operate when the controller is considered to be the gamepad, even if it is the steering wheel. Try to:

    # Run x360ce.exe
    # Select tab with your Wheel Controller.
    # Open [[Advanced]] tab page.
    # Set "Device Type" drop down list value to: GamePad
    # Click [[Save]] button.
    # Close x360ce Application, run game.

*How to reduce wheel dead zone (GTA, Mafia II, ...)?*

    # Run x360ce.exe
    # Select tab with your Wheel Controller.
    # Open [[Advanced]] tab page.
    # Select "Enabled (XInput, 80%)" from "AntiDeadZone" drop down in order to reduce dead zone by 80%.
    # Click [[Save]] button.
    # Close x360ce Application, run game.

    Note: Some games have control issues when the dead zone is reduced by 100%.

*Do I need to run x360ce Application during the game?*

No, You do not need. Close x360ce during the game, because the game does not need it, and the application uses computer resources. The application is just a GUI for editing the x360ce.ini and test controller.
