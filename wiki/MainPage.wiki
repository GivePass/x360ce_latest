"Xbox 360 Controller Emulator" allows your controller (GamePad, Joystick, Wheel, ...) to function like "Xbox 360 Controller" so game will allow to use it. For example it allows you to play games like "Grand Theft Auto" (GTA) or "Mafia II" with Logitech Wheel. 

= System Requirements =

Only Windows XP SP3 and newer systems are supported.

System must have updated DirectX runtime using this installer:

NOTE: Even on Windows 8. Without it x360ce.App will crash!

= Introduction =

"Xbox 360 Controller Emulator" files:

xinput1_3.dll (Library) - Wrapper library that translates the XInput calls to DirectInput calls, for support old, no XInput compatible GamePads.

x360ce.exe - (Application) - Allows edit and test Library settings.

x360ce.ini - (Configuration) - Contain Library settings (button, axis, slider maps). 

= Details =

==  Installation ==

Run this program from game executable directory. Game executable can look for xinput dll by different names, you can create copy of dll with name provided below till you find one that works:

  * xinput1_3.dll
  * xinput1_2.dll
  * xinput1_1.dll
  * xinput9_1_0.dll

== Uninstallation ==

Delete x360ce.exe, x360ce.ini and all xinput dll from game executable directory.

= Troubleshooting =

*Wheel doesn't work in the game, but it works inside x360ce Application.*

Some games work only when controller is disguised as GamePad even if its Wheel. Try to:

    # Run x360ce.exe
    # Select tab with your Wheel Controller.
    # Open [[Advanced]] tab page.
    # Set "Device Type" drop down list value to: GamePad
    # Click [[Save]] button.
    # Close x360ce Application, run game.

*How to reduce wheel dead zone (GTA, Mafia II, ...)?*

    # Run x360ce.exe
    # Select tab with your Wheel Controller.
    # Open [[Advanced]] tab page.
    # Select "Enabled (XInput, 80%)" from "AntiDeadZone" drop down in order to reduce dead zone by 80%.
    # Click [[Save]] button.
    # Close x360ce Application, run game.

    Note: Some games have control issues when dead zone is reduced by 100%.

*Do I need to run x360ce Application during the game?*

No, you don't. Close x360ce Application during the game, because game doesn't need it and Application will consume PC resources. x360ce Application is used only as GUI to edit x360ce.ini file and as controller tester.
